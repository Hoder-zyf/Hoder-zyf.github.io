  abstract     = {While large language models (LLMs) have driven advancements in
the financial area, they often lack sufficient financial knowledge and analytical capability due to their general-domain training corpora. Financial large language models (Financial LLMs) seek to enhance finance by providing domain-specific knowledge and analytical capabilities beyond general-domain training. Yet, they struggle
with downstream tasks and handling multi-modal inputs like tabular and time series data, limiting their effectiveness in critical financial applications such as trading. In this paper, we introduce OpenFinLLMs, a series of Financial LLMs. We start with developing FinLLaMA, pre-trained on a 52 billion token financial corpus covering
text, tables, and time-series data, to embed comprehensive financial knowledge. We then instruction fine-tune it with 573K financial instructions to create FinLLaMA-instruct, enhancing task performance and instruction following. Finally, we present FinLLaVA,
a multimodal LLM based on FinLLaMA, trained using 1,430K multimodal image-text instructions to handle complex financial data types, including tables and charts. We conduct extensive evaluations of FinLLaMA, FinLLaMA-instruct, and FinLLaVA across various tasks and settings. FinLLaMA is tested on 19 datasets in the zero-shot setting and 4 datasets in the few-shot setting, demonstrating superior performance over LLaMA3-8B, LLaMA3.1-8B, and BloombergGPT. FinLLaMA-instruct is evaluated on 15 datasets, achieving higher average performance than GPT-4 and other financial LLMs. FinLLaVA is assessed on 4 multimodal tasks, showing effectiveness in understanding tables and charts. Additionally, we evaluate the trading performance of FinLLaMA using an agent framework across multiple assets, where it achieves impressive Sharpe Ratios, underscoring its strong capability in financial applications.
Our models and evaluation benchmarks will be continually maintained to foster innovations in academia and industry.}
