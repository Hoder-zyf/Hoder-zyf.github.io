:blush: Hi, my name is Yifei Zhang. I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology (FinTech) at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en) from [The Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/mainm.htm).  It was a double degree program, and I am honored to have been admitted to this program. ðŸ™Œ

I am now pursuing a master's degree at [School of Management & Engineering](https://sme.nju.edu.cn/mainm.htm) at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en), specializing in Financial Engineering and FinTech, under the guidance of [Prof. Honghai Yu](https://sme.nju.edu.cn/yhh/list.htm). 


Currently, my research focuses on:

**(1) Social Media:** I am particularly interested in analyzing user behavior and sentiment on platforms like [Xueqiu](https://xueqiu.com/) and [Douyin](https://www.douyin.com/).

**(2) Financial (Multimodal) Large Language Models:** I am collaborating with [Prof. Benyou Wang](https://wabyking.github.io/old.html) and [The Fin AI](https://sites.google.com/view/the-fin-ai/home?authuser=0) to advance research in this area. ðŸ¤–

**(3) RAG:** I am exploring the application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in the financial sector, such as integrating RAG with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to enhance interpretability.
