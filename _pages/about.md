:blush: Hi, my name is Yifei Zhang. I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology (FinTech) at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en) from [The Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/mainm.htm).  It was a double degree program, and I am honored to have been admitted to this program. ðŸ™Œ

I am now pursuing a master's degree at [School of Management & Engineering](https://sme.nju.edu.cn/mainm.htm) at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en), specializing in Financial Engineering and FinTech, under the guidance of [Prof. Honghai Yu](https://sme.nju.edu.cn/yhh/list.htm). 


Currently, my research focuses on:

**(1) Behavioral Finance:** I am particularly interested in studying how human behavior and psychology influence investment decisions, especially in the context of online social media platforms like [Xueqiu](https://xueqiu.com/) and [Douyin](https://www.douyin.com/). This includes analyzing investor sentiment, information diffusion, and decision-making patterns in financial markets.

**(2) AI-Driven Financial Market Simulation:** I am collaborating with my advisor [Prof. Honghai Yu](https://sme.nju.edu.cn/yhh/list.htm) and [Prof. Benyou Wang](https://wabyking.github.io/old.html) on AI stock market research. Our work builds upon the groundbreaking studies from [the Santa Fe Institute(1999)](https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/cs286r/courses/spring08/reading6/artificialstockmarket.pdf) and [Stanford's Artificial Town](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3586183.3606763) , aiming to develop more sophisticated and realistic financial market simulation models. This research will contribute to a better understanding of market dynamics and investor behavior. ðŸ¤–ðŸ“ˆ
