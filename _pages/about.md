:blush: Hi, my name is Yifei Zhang (张逸飞). I am now pursuing a master's degree at [School of Management & Engineering](https://sme.nju.edu.cn/mainm.htm), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en), advised by  [Prof. Honghai Yu](https://sme.nju.edu.cn/yhh/list.htm). 

🎓 I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology, specializing in Computer & Financial Engineering Experimental Class (a Top Talent Program) at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en) from [The Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/mainm.htm). 

🔍 I am fortunate to collaborate closely with [Prof. Benyou Wang](https://wabyking.github.io/old.html) on Large Language Model (LLM) research. My research interests focus on Large **Language Models (LLMs)** and their application to various complex domains, with a significant focus currently in **Finance**.


**Key Project Highlights:** ✨

*   📊 **Open-FinLLMs:** As a core contributor, I helped develop and **open-source** FinLLaVA-8B, the **first** multi-modal LLM specifically engineered to understand complex financial documents including tables and charts, achieving great performance for open models at the time.

*   🎯 **UCFE Benchmark:** I led the creation of the UCFE Benchmark (published at **NAACL Findings 2025**), an innovative dynamic framework using AI simulation (GPT-4o, LLM-as-Judge) to evaluate LLM capabilities in realistic, interactive financial advisory tasks.

*   🤖 **TwinMarket:** I led the TwinMarket project (<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Best Paper Award in Financial AI @ ICLR 2025</span> & selected for **oral** presentation at **ICLR 2025**), engineering a scalable multi-agent simulation framework where LLMs power the reasoning of over 1,000 agents to model complex financial market behaviors and emergent social dynamics.
