:blush: Hello, my name is Yifei Zhang. I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology (FinTech) at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en) from [The Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/mainm.htm).  It was a double degree program, and I am honored to have been admitted to this program. ðŸ™Œ

Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree at [School of Management & Engineering](https://sme.nju.edu.cn/mainm.htm) at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en), specializing in Financial Engineering and FinTech, under the guidance of [Prof. Honghai Yu](https://sme.nju.edu.cn/yhh/list.htm). 

I am conducting financial research on "Social Media," focusing on two main platforms: [Xueqiu](https://xueqiu.com/) and [Douyin](https://www.douyin.com/).  Additionally, I am interested in Financial Multimodal Large Language Models and I am working in collaboration with [Prof. Benyou Wang](https://wabyking.github.io/old.html) and [The Fin AI](https://sites.google.com/view/the-fin-ai/home?authuser=0). ðŸ¤–
