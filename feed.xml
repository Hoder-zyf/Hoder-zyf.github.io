After all, isn’t that what we’re supposed to do to build our resumes and gain experience? However, I’m beginning to realize that learning to say “no” might be just as important as knowing when to say “yes”.</p> <h3 id="why-i-think-saying-no-matters">Why I Think Saying “No” Matters</h3> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Focusing on What’s Important</strong>: As students, we have limited time and energy. Saying “no” to less relevant activities might help us concentrate on our studies and the opportunities that truly align with our goals.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Avoiding Burnout</strong>: It’s easy to overcommit ourselves. Learning to decline some invitations or projects could help maintain a healthier balance between academics, extracurriculars, and personal life.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Staying True to Ourselves</strong>: Sometimes, we might feel pressured to join clubs or take on roles that don’t really interest us. Saying “no” can help us stay authentic to our interests and values.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Building Self-Respect</strong>: By carefully choosing what we commit to, we’re showing respect for our own time and priorities. This seems like an important skill to develop for our future careers.</p> </li> </ol> <h3 id="how-im-learning-to-say-no">How I’m Learning to Say “No”</h3> <p>I’m still figuring this out, but here are some approaches I’m trying:</p> <ol> <li>Being honest about my limitations</li> <li>Expressing gratitude for the opportunity before declining</li> <li>Explaining my reasons briefly, if appropriate</li> <li>Suggesting alternatives if I can</li> </ol> <h3 id="my-limited-experience">My Limited Experience</h3> <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #3498db; padding-left: 20px; font-style: italic; color: #34495e;"> These decisions weren't easy, but they've helped me gain clarity about my values and goals.

The following are key areas I want to focus on, including ongoing projects and new initiatives.</p> <h2 id="1-benchmarks-for-financial-llms">1. Benchmarks for (Financial) LLMs</h2> <p>LLMs have been making groundbreaking advancements in various fields, and financial technology is no exception. However, to unlock their full potential in this domain, the development of specialized benchmarks that account for the unique requirements of financial systems is crucial. This project focuses on designing and implementing benchmarks specifically tailored to evaluate and improve the performance of financial LLMs.</p> <h3 id="11-multi-round-benchmark-ongoing">1.1 Multi-round Benchmark (<span style="color: red;">Ongoing</span>)</h3> <p>The complexity of financial decision-making often requires multi-step reasoning and interactions. Therefore, a single-turn evaluation would not sufficiently capture the nuanced performance needed for real-world financial tasks. A multi-round benchmark, by contrast, would evaluate LLMs across extended dialogues, simulating real-world interactions where financial models are engaged in iterative decision-making processes.</p> <div style="font-size: medium; text-align: center; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; color: orange">We shall coporate with <a href="http://llmeval.org.cn/industry_UCF_Bench" style="color: orange;">“Chaosui Cup” National Competition of Innovative Development of Large Language Models</a> and then relase our benchmark soon.</div> <p> </p> <h3 id="12-multimodal-benchmark-would-begin-soon">1.2 Multimodal Benchmark (<span style="color: blue;">Would Begin Soon</span>)</h3> <p>In the financial world, language is not the only input format; financial analysis often involves interpreting graphs, tables, charts, and other non-textual data. Therefore, a comprehensive benchmark should include multimodal inputs, such as combining textual financial news with accompanying stock charts.</p> <div style="font-size: medium; text-align: center; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; color: orange">We shall make use of data of <strong style="font-size: medium; text-align: center; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; color: red">XBRL</strong> format from <strong style="font-size: medium; text-align: center; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; color: red">SEC</strong> and mainly focus on financial statements and financial charts.</div> <p> </p> <h2 id="2-research-on-online-social-media-platforms-like-xueqiu-ongoing">2. Research on Online Social Media Platforms like Xueqiu (<span style="color: red;">Ongoing</span>)</h2> <p>Online social media platforms like Xueqiu (雪球) have become valuable hubs where influential voices discuss market trends, companies, and their own investment strategies. The goal of this research is to analyze the semantic association between influential figures and the companies they mention, while also investigating the alignment between their publicly stated opinions and actual trading behavior (both in real and simulated markets).</p> <div style="font-size: medium; text-align: center; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; color: orange">My undergraduate thesis mainly focus on <em>Consistency or Discrepancy between Words and Actions based on Xueqiu Platform</em> and I would like to go deeper into the project.</div> <p> </p> <h2 id="3-integrating-large-language-models-with-financial-applications-conceptual-stage">3. Integrating Large Language Models with Financial Applications (<span style="color: blue;">Conceptual Stage</span>)</h2> <p>To truly revolutionize financial technology, integrating LLMs into practical financial applications is essential. This section explores how LLMs can be embedded into various tools to perform sophisticated financial analysis and decision-making, with a focus on three key areas: 1) leveraging LLMs to interpret satellite imagery for financial insights, 2) assisting in calculating company innovation indices, and 3) helping assess the degree of aging in populations.</p> <h3 id="31-using-satellite-imagery-in-financial-analysis">3.1 Using Satellite Imagery in Financial Analysis</h3> <p>Satellite imagery provides an untapped source of real-time data that can offer unique insights into market movements, especially in sectors like agriculture, infrastructure, and transportation. The goal is to leverage LLMs to analyze this imagery, uncover trends, and translate the findings into meaningful financial interpretations.</p> <h3 id="32-assisting-in-calculating-company-innovation-indices">3.2 Assisting in Calculating Company Innovation Indices</h3> <p>Innovation is a critical driver of company growth and market valuation. LLMs can play a significant role in quantifying a company’s innovation capabilities by analyzing diverse data sources.</p> <h3 id="33-assessing-population-aging-for-financial-and-social-impact">3.3 Assessing Population Aging for Financial and Social Impact</h3> <p>Aging populations pose significant challenges for both economies and financial systems, especially in regions where pension and healthcare costs are rising. LLMs can assist in modeling the aging degree of populations and assessing the financial impact.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="ideas"/><category term="finance"/><category term="research"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some ideas about the next stage research]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">An Unforgettable Night at Jacky Cheung’s Concert</title><link href="https://hoder-zyf.github.io/blog/2024/zhangxueyou-concerts/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="An Unforgettable Night at Jacky Cheung’s Concert"/><published>2024-08-23T23:32:13+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-23T23:32:13+00:00</updated><id>https://hoder-zyf.github.io/blog/2024/zhangxueyou-concerts</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://hoder-zyf.github.io/blog/2024/zhangxueyou-concerts/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="image-slider">Image Slider</h2> <swiper-container keyboard="true" navigation="true" pagination="true" pagination-clickable="true" pagination-dynamic-bullets="true" rewind="true"> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/zhangxueyou/0-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/zhangxueyou/0-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/zhangxueyou/0-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/zhangxueyou/0.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/zhangxueyou/1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/zhangxueyou/1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/zhangxueyou/1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/zhangxueyou/1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/zhangxueyou/2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/zhangxueyou/2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/zhangxueyou/2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/zhangxueyou/2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/zhangxueyou/3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/zhangxueyou/3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/zhangxueyou/3-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/zhangxueyou/3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/zhangxueyou/4-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/zhangxueyou/4-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/zhangxueyou/4-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/zhangxueyou/4.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/zhangxueyou/5-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/zhangxueyou/5-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/zhangxueyou/5-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/zhangxueyou/5.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/zhangxueyou/6-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/zhangxueyou/6-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/zhangxueyou/6-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/zhangxueyou/6.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/zhangxueyou/7-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/zhangxueyou/7-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/zhangxueyou/7-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/zhangxueyou/7.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> </swiper-container> <h2 id="the-experience-from-anticipation-to-awe-">The Experience: From Anticipation to Awe 🎉</h2> <p>The excitement began building long before the concert started. As I made my way through the crowded venue, the buzz of anticipation was palpable. 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️ Despite my seat being quite far back, I was determined to make the most of this opportunity to see the legendary Jacky Cheung live. 🎤🌟</p> <p>As the lights dimmed and the first notes rang out, a collective gasp rippled through the audience. 😮 Cheung’s entrance was nothing short of spectacular - a perfect blend of dramatic lighting and powerful music that immediately set the tone for the evening. 🌆✨ Even from my distant seat, I could feel the energy radiating from the stage. 🔊💺</p> <p>Throughout the night, Cheung’s voice filled every corner of the arena with a richness and depth that recordings simply can’t capture. 🎶📀 From upbeat pop hits to soulful ballads, his vocal range and control were truly impressive. 🎵 The way he effortlessly hit both the highest notes and the deepest low tones left me in awe. 🎼👏</p> <p>What struck me most was how Cheung managed to make such a large venue feel intimate. 🏟️💖 His between-song banter was charming and genuine, often sharing personal anecdotes or the stories behind his songs. 🗣️🎧 This connection with the audience, despite the physical distance, made the experience all the more special.</p> <h2 id="capturing-moments-a-race-against-time-️">Capturing Moments: A Race Against Time ⏱️</h2> <p>Determined to preserve memories of this incredible night, I had my smartphone at the ready from the moment the show began. 📱👀 The challenge was real - balancing the desire to capture every moment with the need to actually experience the concert firsthand.</p> <p>One of my favorite captured moments was during “She Came to My Concert”. 🎶 The way Cheung interacted with the audience during this song, pointing and smiling at different sections, made everyone feel seen and appreciated. 🤳😄</p> <p>As the night progressed, I found myself becoming more selective with my recording, choosing to fully immerse myself in certain songs rather than view them through my phone screen. 🎧👁️ It was during one of these moments, lost in the music, that I realized my phone had finally given up the ghost, its battery drained. 😔🔋</p> <p>Initially disappointed, I soon realized this was a blessing in disguise. 😇 Without the distraction of my phone, I was able to lose myself completely in the final acts of the show, creating memories that no video could ever truly capture. 🎥❌</p> <h2 id="highlight-of-the-night-steal-my-heart-steals-the-show-️">Highlight of the Night: “Steal My Heart” Steals the Show 💖🎟️</h2> <p>The moment I had been waiting for all night finally arrived when the opening notes of “Steal My Heart” filled the air. 🎶❤️ The crowd’s reaction was immediate and electric - clearly, I wasn’t the only one who considered this a favorite.</p> <p>Cheung’s performance of this song was nothing short of magical. 🧙‍♂️✨ He began softly, his voice laden with emotion, building gradually as the song progressed. 🔝 The raw passion in his delivery gave new depth to lyrics I thought I knew by heart. 💬 As he reached the chorus, his voice soared, powerful and clear, sending chills down my spine. 🌪️</p> <p>What made this performance truly special was how Cheung seemed to pour his entire soul into the song. 💓 His facial expressions and body language conveyed the depth of the emotions behind the lyrics. 😌🎭 As he sang, you could see the intensity in his eyes, a connection not just with the audience but with the music itself.</p> <p>When the final note of “Steal My Heart” faded, the arena was filled with a momentary silence, as if everyone needed a breath to process the raw power of what they’d just witnessed. 😯🕊️ Then, the applause began, slowly at first, then swelling into a deafening roar. 👏👏👏 It was clear that this was not just a highlight for me but for everyone in attendance.</p> <h2 id="the-afterglow-memories-that-will-last-a-lifetime-️">The Afterglow: Memories That Will Last a Lifetime 🌟🕰️</h2> <p>As the house lights came up and the crowd began to disperse, I found myself lingering in my seat, reluctant to leave the scene of such an extraordinary experience. 🏠👀 The energy of the concert still buzzed through me, and I could see it in the faces of those around me—people who, like me, had been profoundly moved by the night’s performances.</p> <p>On the way out, snippets of conversations floated through the air—fans reliving their favorite moments, sharing their emotional highs, and expressing their admiration for Cheung’s unparalleled talent. 🗣️🎼 There was a sense of camaraderie among us, a bond forged through a shared love of music and a deep appreciation for an artist who had given us so much.</p> <h2 id="reflections-more-than-just-a-concert-">Reflections: More Than Just a Concert 🤔🎭</h2> <p>In the days that followed, the memories of that night stayed with me, lingering like the final notes of a beloved song. 🎶💭 It wasn’t just the music that made it special, though that was certainly a huge part of it. It was the entire experience—the anticipation, the shared joy, the feeling of being part of something larger than myself.</p> <p>Jacky Cheung’s concert was more than just a performance; it was a reminder of the power of music to connect us, to evoke emotions, and to create lasting memories. 🌈💞 Even now, as I replay those moments in my mind, I can still feel the emotions they stirred within me.</p> <p>And while I may have left the concert without a complete video record of the night, what I gained was something far more valuable: an experience that will live on in my heart, a night that truly stole my heart. ❤️🎼</p> <h2 id="the-legacy-of-jacky-cheung-a-lasting-impact-">The Legacy of Jacky Cheung: A Lasting Impact 🌍🎵</h2> <p>Jacky Cheung’s influence on the music industry, particularly in the Mandopop and Cantopop genres, cannot be overstated. 🌏🎶 His ability to blend powerful vocals with meaningful lyrics has made him a beloved figure not just in Asia but around the world. Attending his concert was a powerful reminder of why he has remained at the top of his game for so many years.</p> <p>His dedication to his craft, his ability to connect with audiences, and his passion for music are qualities that make him more than just a singer; they make him a legend. 📚👑 For those of us who had the privilege of attending that concert, we witnessed a master at work—an artist who has given his life to his art and who continues to inspire others with his talent and humility.</p> <p>As I look back on that unforgettable night, I am filled with a deep sense of gratitude. 🙏 Gratitude for the music that has been a part of my life for so long, for the memories that I will carry with me forever, and for the opportunity to have been a part of something truly special.</p> <p>In the end, it wasn’t just a concert; it was a celebration of music, of life, and of the incredible talent that is Jacky Cheung. 🎉🎈 And that, more than anything, is what made that night truly unforgettable.</p> <h2 id="my-favourite-song-of-jacky-cheung">My favourite song of Jacky Cheung</h2> <p>My favorite song of Jacky Cheung is “三分拍” (Three-Quarter Time). The song’s unique waltz rhythm and emotionally rich lyrics perfectly capture the push and pull of relationships, where love is both a dance and a journey. Jacky Cheung’s heartfelt delivery and the song’s introspective tone resonate deeply with me, making it a timeless piece that reflects the complexities of love, the desire for freedom, and the beauty of finding balance in a relationship.

This study leverages empirical data from Xueqiu, a prominent social trading platform, by integrating advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, sentiment dictionaries, BGE-M3 word embedding models, and Generative Pre-trained Transformer models (GPT-4). Our primary objective is to scrutinize the alignment between investors’ discourse on social media and their actual trading activities.</p> <p>The analysis reveals a pronounced congruence between the narratives shared by investors on Xueqiu and their market behaviors. By incorporating variables such as gender and the clarity of information, this research elucidates the factors that drive consistency between verbal expressions and trading actions. Notably, it is observed that male participants and individuals who articulate their thoughts more clearly are predisposed to higher levels of behavioral consistency.</p> <p>Moreover, the study quantifies the market effects of this consistency by calculating Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CAR) and Investment returns (Inv_ret), underpinning the substantive role of social media information in financial markets. These insights offer crucial decision-making support to both investors and regulatory bodies, highlighting the transformative impact of online financial dialogues.</p> <h2 id="awards">Awards</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Second Prize, Third ”Xueshi Cup” Academic Paper Competition of Nanjing University</strong></li> <li><strong>Outstanding Undergraduate Thesis</strong></li> </ul> <p> </p> <div style="font-size: large; text-align: center; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; color: orange">If you are interested in my undergraduate thesis, welcome to contact me through the social media on my "about" page, or you can add my wechat number through this tricky problem:</div> <p> </p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python
